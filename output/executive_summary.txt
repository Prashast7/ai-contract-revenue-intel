# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ACME SaaS Contract

**Contract ID:** contract_acme_saas_001

## FINANCIAL EXPOSURE

**Total Revenue at Risk: $6,300**

- **Unbilled Revenue (Immediate Recovery):** $4,500
  - Q1-2024: $3,000 in user overage fees (40 users above 500-user limit)
  - Q2-2024: $1,500 in user overage fees (20 users above limit)
  - *This represents 18.75% revenue leakage on base subscription*

- **Potential Service Credits (Liability):** $1,800
  - Q1-2024: $600 credit exposure (99.1% uptime vs. 99.5% SLA)
  - Q2-2024: $1,200 credit exposure (98.7% uptime vs. 99.5% SLA)
  - *Credits only apply if customer submits written claims within 30 days*

## CONTRACT RISK LEVEL: **HIGH**

**Critical Issue:** Deteriorating service quality is triggering termination rights.

- Service uptime declined from 99.1% to 98.7% over two consecutive quarters
- One more SLA breach within the next two quarters triggers:
  - $2,000 contractual penalty
  - Customer's right to terminate for cause
  
**Root Causes:**
- No automated monitoring for user count overages
- Operational issues causing consistent uptime failures
- Reactive rather than proactive customer management

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)
1. **Bill the $4,500 in overages immediately** – recover lost revenue from Q1 and Q2
2. **Launch urgent investigation** into uptime failures and implement fixes before Q3
3. **Proactively contact customer** about service improvements before they file SLA credit claims
4. **Deploy automated usage tracking** to prevent future billing failures

### Strategic (Next 90 Days)
5. **Establish monthly service reviews** with customer to rebuild trust and demonstrate commitment
6. **Create early warning system** that escalates when uptime drops below 99.3%
7. **Prepare retention strategy** including potential pricing concessions if needed to prevent termination
8. **Document and communicate** infrastructure improvement roadmap to customer

**Bottom Line:** We must recover $4,500 in unbilled revenue while simultaneously preventing customer churn. Service quality improvements are non-negotiable to avoid termination and protect this account's ongoing revenue stream.
